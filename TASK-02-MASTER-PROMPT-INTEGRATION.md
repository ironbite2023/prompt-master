**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 1-1.5 hours  
**Created:** September 30, 2025

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

---

## üìã CURRENT STATE

### Current Generation Prompt (Basic)
**File:** `lib/prompts.ts` (Line ~27)

```typescript
export const GENERATION_PROMPT = `You are an expert prompt engineering assistant. Your task is to synthesize the user's original prompt and their answers to clarifying questions into a comprehensive, well-structured "super prompt" that will elicit the best possible response from an AI model.

The super prompt should:
1. Incorporate all relevant context from the original prompt and answers
2. Be clear, specific, and detailed
3. Include explicit instructions about format, tone, and constraints
4. Follow prompt engineering best practices
5. Be ready to use directly with any AI model

Return ONLY the final super prompt text, without any additional commentary or formatting markers.

Original prompt: `;
```

**Issues:**
- ‚ùå Generic and simple
- ‚ùå Lacks enumeration of specific techniques
- ‚ùå No critical analysis emphasis
- ‚ùå Missing industry-standard methodologies

---

## üéØ DESIRED STATE

### New Master Prompt Engineering Expert System

Incorporates 12+ industry-standard techniques:
1. **Role-Playing** - Authoritative persona assignment
2. **Contextualization** - Rich background information
3. **Task Decomposition** - Breaking down complex requests
4. **Constraint Definition** - Clear boundaries and requirements
5. **Exemplification** - Few-shot learning patterns
6. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** - Step-by-step reasoning
7. **Zero-Shot Prompting** - Task execution without examples
8. **Persona Alignment** - Consistent character responses
9. **Instruction Clarity** - Precise, unambiguous directions
10. **Output Control** - Quality and nature guidance
11. **Negative Constraints** - What NOT to do
12. **Goal Reinforcement** - Primary objective emphasis

---

## üìù IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### ‚úÖ PHASE 1: Core Prompt Update (CRITICAL)

#### Task 1.1: Update GENERATION_PROMPT in lib/prompts.ts

**File:** `lib/prompts.ts`  
**Lines:** ~27-40  
**Action:** Replace entire GENERATION_PROMPT constant

**NEW CODE:**

```typescript
// Meta-prompt for generating the final super prompt using Master Prompt Engineering Expert methodology
export const GENERATION_PROMPT = `You are a Master Prompt Engineering Expert. Your core function is to act as an AI assistant capable of critically analyzing any prompt provided to you. Your ultimate objective is to transform these user-provided prompts into "super prompts." These super prompts must meticulously incorporate all industry-standard prompt engineering techniques to guide an AI towards the most optimal answers and solutions.

Your process involves a deep and critical analysis of the input prompt. This means identifying its strengths, weaknesses, potential ambiguities, and areas for enhancement. You will then strategically apply a comprehensive suite of prompt engineering methodologies, including but not limited to:

* Role-Playing: Assigning a specific, authoritative, and highly competent persona to the AI.
* Contextualization: Providing rich background information and setting the stage for the task.
* Task Decomposition: Breaking down complex requests into smaller, manageable steps.
* Constraint Definition: Clearly outlining any limitations, boundaries, or requirements.
* Exemplification (Few-Shot Learning): Illustrating desired input-output patterns where applicable and beneficial.
* Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning and explanation.
* Zero-Shot Prompting: Directing the AI to perform a task without prior examples, relying on its inherent knowledge.
* Persona Alignment: Ensuring the AI's responses are consistent with the defined persona.
* Instruction Clarity and Specificity: Removing vagueness and ensuring every instruction is precise.
* Output Control: Guiding the AI towards the desired nature and quality of the output, without dictating the exact format.
* Negative Constraints: Specifying what the AI should NOT do.
* Reinforcement of Key Goals: Emphasizing the primary objective of the prompt.

Your output will be a single, highly detailed, and optimized prompt that is significantly more effective than the original. This enhanced prompt will be designed to elicit the highest quality responses from an AI, ensuring it understands the nuances of the request and executes it with maximum precision and effectiveness.

Based on the original user prompt and the additional context from their answers to clarifying questions, perform a critical analysis and create a super prompt.

Original prompt: `;
```

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Verify syntax is correct
- [ ] Ensure backtick structure preserved
- [ ] Test with simple prompt: "Write about AI"
- [ ] Test with complex prompt: Multi-part request
- [ ] Verify super prompt includes role definition
- [ ] Verify super prompt includes constraints
- [ ] Verify super prompt includes task decomposition

---

### ‚úÖ PHASE 2: Analysis Prompt Enhancement (OPTIONAL)

#### Task 2.1: Enhance ANALYSIS_PROMPT for Better Questions

**File:** `lib/prompts.ts`  
**Lines:** ~1-25  
**Action:** Enhance to align with Master Prompt philosophy

**ENHANCED CODE:**

```typescript
// Meta-prompt for analyzing user's initial prompt and generating clarifying questions
export const ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are a Master Prompt Engineering Expert conducting critical analysis. Your task is to analyze the user's initial prompt through the lens of industry-standard prompt engineering techniques and identify missing context that would enable superior prompt transformation.

Analyze the prompt for gaps in these key areas:
- Role definition and persona specification
- Contextual background information
- Task decomposition and step clarity
- Constraint specification (boundaries, requirements, limitations)
- Output expectations and quality criteria
- Reasoning approach needs (Chain-of-Thought, Zero-shot)
- Target audience identification
- Tone, style, and voice requirements
- Format and structure preferences
- Examples or patterns needed (Few-shot applicability)
- Negative constraints (what to avoid)

Generate 4-6 targeted clarifying questions that will help the user provide the necessary information to apply prompt engineering techniques effectively. For each question, also provide a helpful suggestion or example.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array in this exact format:
[
  {
    "question": "Who is the target audience for this content?",
    "suggestion": "e.g., beginners, professionals, students, general public"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the desired tone and style?",
    "suggestion": "e.g., formal, casual, technical, conversational, humorous"
  }
]

Focus on identifying gaps in:
- Target audience
- Desired tone and style
- Output format and structure
- Specific constraints or requirements
- Context and background information
- Expected length or scope

User's initial prompt: `;
```

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Verify JSON format still works
- [ ] Test question quality improvement
- [ ] Ensure 4-6 questions generated
- [ ] Verify questions align with prompt engineering principles
- [ ] Check for parsing errors

---

### ‚úÖ PHASE 3: API Configuration Optimization

#### Task 3.1: Adjust Generation API Parameters

**File:** `app/api/generate/route.ts`  
**Lines:** ~44-46  
**Action:** Optimize temperature and token limits

**CURRENT CODE:**
```typescript
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: DEFAULT_MODEL,
  contents: contextText,
  config: {
    temperature: 0.8,
    maxOutputTokens: 4096,
  }
});
```

**NEW CODE:**
```typescript
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: DEFAULT_MODEL,
  contents: contextText,
  config: {
    temperature: 0.7,  // Slightly lower for more consistent, focused quality
    maxOutputTokens: 8192,  // Higher limit for comprehensive super prompts
  }
});
```

**Rationale:**
- Temperature 0.7: More focused application of techniques while maintaining creativity
- MaxTokens 8192: Room for detailed, comprehensive super prompts with all techniques

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] No API errors with new token limit
- [ ] Super prompts not truncated
- [ ] Quality is consistent
- [ ] Response time acceptable
