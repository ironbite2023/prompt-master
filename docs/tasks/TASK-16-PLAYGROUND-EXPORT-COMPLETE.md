## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **1. Added Helper Function: `getLatestAnswer()`**

```typescript
const getLatestAnswer = (answers: PromptAnswer[]): PromptAnswer | null => {
  if (!answers || answers.length === 0) return null;
  
  // Sort by created_at descending (most recent first)
  const sorted = [...answers].sort((a, b) => {
    const dateA = new Date(a.created_at).getTime();
    const dateB = new Date(b.created_at).getTime();
    return dateB - dateA;
  });
  
  return sorted[0]; // Return most recent
};
```

**Logic:**
- Takes array of playground answers
- Sorts by timestamp (newest first)
- Returns most recent answer
- Returns null if no answers

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- ✅ Empty array → null
- ✅ Undefined → null
- ✅ Single answer → return it
- ✅ Multiple answers → newest

---

### **2. Updated ExportRow Interface**

**Before (9 fields):**
```typescript
export interface ExportRow {
  title: string;
  created_at: string;
  bucket_name: string;
  category: string;
  subcategory: string;
  analysis_mode: string;
  original_idea: string;
  optimized_prompt: string;
  tags: string;
}
```

**After (12 fields):**
```typescript
export interface ExportRow {
  title: string;
  created_at: string;
  bucket_name: string;
  category: string;
  subcategory: string;
  analysis_mode: string;
  original_idea: string;
  optimized_prompt: string;
  tags: string;
  // NEW FIELDS:
  latest_playground_answer: string;
  latest_answer_notes: string;
  latest_answer_date: string;
}
```

---

### **3. Updated flattenPromptData() Function**

**Added logic:**
```typescript
// Get latest playground answer
const latestAnswer = getLatestAnswer(answers);

return {
  // ... existing 9 fields ...
  
  // Playground results
  latest_playground_answer: latestAnswer?.answer_text || '',
  latest_answer_notes: latestAnswer?.notes || '',
  latest_answer_date: latestAnswer ? formatUserFriendlyDate(latestAnswer.created_at) : '',
};
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Calls helper function to find latest
- ✅ Uses optional chaining (`?.`)
- ✅ Defaults to empty strings
- ✅ Formats date consistently
- ✅ No errors if no answers

---

## 📋 Example CSV Output

### **Scenario 1: Prompt with Multiple Tests**

**Database:**
```json
{
  "prompt": {
    "title": "Newsletter Template",
    "created_at": "2025-10-04T07:58:37Z"
  },
  "answers": [
    {
      "created_at": "2025-10-04T08:00:00Z",
      "answer_text": "First test result...",
      "notes": "Not great"
    },
    {
      "created_at": "2025-10-04T08:15:00Z",
      "answer_text": "Much better version...",
      "notes": "Perfect for Q4 campaign"
    },
    {
      "created_at": "2025-10-04T08:05:00Z",
      "answer_text": "Second test...",
      "notes": "Getting there"
    }
  ]
}
```

**CSV Export:**
```csv

"Newsletter Template","04/10/2025 07:58",...,"Much better version...","Perfect for Q4 campaign","04/10/2025 08:15"
```

**Result:** ✅ Latest answer (08:15) exported, not first or middle

---

### **Scenario 2: Untested Prompt**

**Database:**
```json
{
  "prompt": {
    "title": "Draft Idea",
    "created_at": "2025-10-04T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "answers": []
}
```

**CSV Export:**
```csv
title,created_at,...,latest_playground_answer,latest_answer_notes,latest_answer_date
"Draft Idea","04/10/2025 10:00",...,"","",""
```

**Result:** ✅ Empty fields, no errors

---

### **Scenario 3: Test with No Notes**

**Database:**
```json
{
  "prompt": {
    "title": "Quick Test",
    "created_at": "2025-10-04T09:00:00Z"
  },
  "answers": [
    {
      "created_at": "2025-10-04T09:15:00Z",
      "answer_text": "Good result here...",
      "notes": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**CSV Export:**
```csv
title,created_at,...,latest_playground_answer,latest_answer_notes,latest_answer_date
"Quick Test","04/10/2025 09:00",...,"Good result here...","","04/10/2025 09:15"
```

**Result:** ✅ Answer included, notes empty (not "null")
