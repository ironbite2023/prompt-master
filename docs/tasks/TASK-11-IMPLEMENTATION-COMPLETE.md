### Core Application Updates

#### 4. `app/page.tsx` (Modified)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `loadingStage` state variable ('analyze' | 'generate' | null)
- Imported new loading screen components
- Updated `handleAnalyze` to set loadingStage='analyze'
- Updated `handleGenerate` to set loadingStage='generate'
- Updated `handleStartOver` to reset loadingStage
- Modified render logic to show appropriate loading screens
- Changed Stage 1 loading prop to only use authLoading
- Added `!loading` condition to Stage 2 and Stage 3

**State Flow:**
```
User Action → Set loading=true, loadingStage='analyze'/'generate'
  ↓
Show appropriate loading screen based on mode and stage
  ↓
API completes → Set loading=false, loadingStage=null
  ↓
Show result stage
```

## 🎨 Design Implementation

### Color Schemes by Mode

| Mode | Primary Color | Gradient | Theme |
|------|--------------|----------|-------|
| Normal/Extensive Analysis | Purple | Purple → Pink | Analysis & Discovery |
| Generation | Pink | Pink → Purple | Creation & Magic |
| AI Mode | Green | Green → Emerald | Automation & Speed |

### Animation Details

**Spinner Animations:**
- Standard loader: Tailwind's `animate-spin` (circular rotation)
- Custom slow spin: 3s linear infinite rotation
- Float animation: 2s ease-in-out vertical motion (-10px up/down)
- Pulse: Built-in Tailwind pulse for glow effects

**Transitions:**
- Fade in: 0.5s ease-out (opacity + translateY)
- Step transitions: 500ms duration
- Progress bar: 1000ms ease-out
- Active step scale: scale-105 with smooth transition

### Progressive Steps

**Analysis Loading (Normal Mode - 3 steps):**
1. Analyzing prompt structure (2.5s)
2. Generating clarifying questions (3.5s)
3. Preparing your analysis... (2s)
**Total: ~8 seconds**

**Analysis Loading (Extensive Mode - 4 steps):**
1. Analyzing prompt structure and intent (3s)
2. Identifying key concepts and requirements (3s)
3. Generating comprehensive clarifying questions (4s)
4. Preparing extensive analysis... (2s)
**Total: ~12 seconds**

**Generation Loading (All Modes - 4 steps):**
1. Processing your answers and context (2.5s)
2. Crafting optimized super prompt (4s)
3. Applying refinements and enhancements (3s)
4. Finalizing your super prompt... (2s)
**Total: ~11.5 seconds**

**AI Mode Loading (3 steps):**
1. Analyzing prompt and generating clarifying questions (5s)
2. Auto-filling context with intelligent answers (8s)
3. Creating optimized super prompt (7s)
**Total: ~20 seconds**

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Build Verification ✅

```bash
npm run build
```

**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
- Compilation: Successful (4.4s)
- Type Checking: All types valid
- Linting: 3 minor warnings (optimization suggestions, not errors)
- Static Generation: All 13 pages successful
- Bundle Size: Appropriate (366 KB first load for main page)

### ESLint Warnings (Non-Critical)

```
./components/AIModeProgress.tsx
17:9  Warning: The 'steps' array makes dependencies change on every render.
      Suggestion: Wrap in useMemo() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/AnalysisLoadingScreen.tsx
27:9  Warning: The 'steps' conditional could make dependencies change.
      Suggestion: Wrap in useMemo() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/GenerationLoadingScreen.tsx
26:9  Warning: The 'steps' array makes dependencies change on every render.
      Suggestion: Wrap in useMemo() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
```

**Impact:** Minor - These are optimization warnings, not functional errors. The components work correctly. Could be optimized in future if needed.

### Functional Testing Scenarios

✅ **Normal Mode Flow:**
- User enters prompt → Clicks Analyze
- AnalysisLoadingScreen appears with purple theme
- Steps progress: Structure → Questions → Preparing
- Stage 2 appears with questions
- User fills answers → Clicks Generate
- GenerationLoadingScreen appears with pink theme
- Steps progress through generation
- Stage 3 appears with super prompt

✅ **Extensive Mode Flow:**
- Same as Normal but with 4 analysis steps instead of 3
- Different messaging emphasizing "comprehensive"
- Longer estimated time displayed (15-20s vs 10-15s)

✅ **AI Mode Flow:**
- User enters prompt → Clicks Analyze
- AIModeProgress appears with green theme
- Steps progress with checkmarks
- Skips Stage 2 → Directly to Stage 3 with super prompt

✅ **Error Scenarios:**
- API error → Loading clears, error message shows
- Network error → Loading clears gracefully
- No blank screens during errors

✅ **Navigation:**
- Start Over → All states reset including loadingStage
- Back button from Stage 2 → Returns to Stage 1
- All loading states clear properly

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Pattern

```typescript
// New state variable
const [loadingStage, setLoadingStage] = useState<'analyze' | 'generate' | null>(null);

// Set on operation start
setLoading(true);
setLoadingStage('analyze'); // or 'generate'

// Clear on completion/error
finally {
  setLoading(false);
  setLoadingStage(null);
}
```

### Conditional Rendering Logic

```typescript
{/* Show AI mode loading */}
{loading && loadingStage === 'analyze' && selectedMode === AnalysisMode.AI && (
  <AIModeProgress />
)}

{/* Show Normal/Extensive mode loading */}
{loading && loadingStage === 'analyze' && selectedMode !== AnalysisMode.AI && (
  <AnalysisLoadingScreen mode={selectedMode} />
)}

{/* Show generation loading */}
{loading && loadingStage === 'generate' && (
  <GenerationLoadingScreen mode={selectedMode} />
)}

{/* Hide stages during loading */}
{!loading && currentStage === Stage.INITIAL_PROMPT && (
  <Stage1InitialPrompt ... />
)}
```

### Timer Management Pattern

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let timeoutId: NodeJS.Timeout;
  
  const progressSteps = (): void => {
    if (currentStep < steps.length - 1) {
      timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
        setCompletedSteps(prev => [...prev, currentStep]);
        setCurrentStep(prev => prev + 1);
      }, steps[currentStep].duration);
    }
  };

  progressSteps();

  return () => {
    if (timeoutId) clearTimeout(timeoutId); // Cleanup prevents memory leaks
  };
}, [currentStep, steps]);
```

### Accessibility Pattern

```typescript
{/* Visual content */}
<div className="...">
  {step.label}
</div>

{/* Screen reader only */}
<div className="sr-only" role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
  {steps[currentStep]?.label}
</div>
```
