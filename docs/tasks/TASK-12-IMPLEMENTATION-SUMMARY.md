## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Migration fails with "relation already exists"  
**Solution:** Table already created, skip to Step 2

**Issue:** API returns 401 Unauthorized  
**Solution:** Check Supabase auth middleware, verify user session

**Issue:** Gemini generation fails  
**Solution:** Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`, check API quota

**Issue:** Answers not displaying  
**Solution:** Check browser console, verify RLS policies allow SELECT

**Issue:** TypeScript errors after pulling  
**Solution:** Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are up-to-date
